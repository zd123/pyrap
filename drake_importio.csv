Fans keep trying on guessing My record ain't even finish they keep trying to press it Boi-1da and Drake if there's beef I address it And the black Phantom is here soon as we find our exit Both of the deals nothing under a mill We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it Long as I got me some heat through the winter Drake known as a pro I'mma teach you beginners Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer For features ya'll better get me while its cheaper than dinner Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl If you see her tell this nigga got some beats I'mma sell her [Hook x2] [Verse 2:] Check the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it So now you at the store for some blank CDs You can't see me for your sake might wanna return it Cause if you bring them discs home to ya girl she'll forget you And I'll be the only one she concerned with To the people that ignored me before this This one is for you as a song re-recorded Funny thing is you just notice me now But I was here along your vision's just been distorted I'm so throwed [?] and I write a sixteen and record it The waiting is over I think music need it Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded People in the South want it chopped and screwed I got this dude They expectations I'mma exceed it Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit Finally here I'mma star with the timing My swagger is chill and my flow is reclining This for anybody that's searchin for cash And purchase so fast you only get the dough when you grindin And so I grind like I'm listening to all Wayne My pain you can experience through the rhyming boy [Hook x2] [Verse 3:] Two years ago a friend of mine Asked me to kick some new school lines And so I sent him a rhyme it was fresh to death Now not signing me is something that the rest regret Then I hopped inside the Cadillac The chauffeur drove off and we never came back [Hook]

Tell em I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself. ayo ayo ayo....[repeat 4x] [Verse 2:] This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya. Especially when you think no one's understandin ya. These girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder clickin they cameras.

Now hopefully let them see What they say that I'm gon' be And if not our whole future does in the memory of me. Get your team in order assembly is key. And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea. They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty. Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard. But I'm just trying to swerve. Without hitting the curb. That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them. And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them. I am not them. I photoshop them out. 'Cause they don't understand what I'm about. Yeah. The Chris Paul Of this fall Sittin' this tall. I float high Goodbye I will miss y'all.

Yeah! But I ain't stuntin' these hoes I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O. Yeah! I'm wild Drizzy tough and the Kid vicious. The three horseman we just need Sid Vicious. Yeah! I'm on the cup of that tilt. And if you hatin' on me I'll say fuck you like Wilt. Yeah! Im a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast. My two fingers make a gun that shoot and kill ya peace. Yeah! Talkin' big big shit. I am rude I take food From a kid picnic. Nigga. Yeah! And we can bang like bumper cars. You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars. Haha.

Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans. I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger. And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter. I hustle harder. I live in the Carter.

Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur? And the Feds will never get me Like a backwards Password Black spur Go some like Pacman cats first. Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin over the banister Ask her Am I their man Her answer Is yessir. Shit. I'm tourin' state to state I played the RTA 'Bout a quarter a day. Now tell them bitches. [Drake chorus] I did it all on my own Turned a chair to a throne I'm a king in this world (Stunt hard) I put my whole city on To some things that they never would've known If I didn't (Stunt hard) And every night is a premiere If I ever dissapear Best believe I'm comin' back.

[Verse 1: Drake] It’s your worst nightmare it’s my first night here And this girl right here who knows what she knows? So I’m going through her phone if she go to the bathroom And her purse right there I don’t trust these hoes at all But that’s just the result of me paying attention To all these women that think like men with the same intentions Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention Even a couple pornstars that I’m ashamed to mention But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models Heffer and Jordan are my only role models That’s why I walk around with all this gold on And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems Buy them sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings All of the little accents that make me a king I never hear the disses they try and point out to me But it’s whatever if somebody wan’ make it a thing I’m more concerned what niggas thinkin’ about Christmas in August Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters Get some shake a brick in the press And chef it like Mrs. Fields they’re making the cookie stretch I know it so well I know the hustle so well Stunt like I’m workin’ overnighters right by the motel Drug money outfit record clean Spend it all on me and my fuckin’ team Matchin’ Rollies for real matchin’ Rovers for real Places they say they’ve been we’ve actually going for real I’m really killin’ shit fuck all the jiggy rappin’ I’m going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy Mixtape legend underground kings Lookin’ for the right way to do the wrong things With my new bitch that’s living in Palm Springs Young ass nigga lifelong dreams They take the greats from the past and compare us I wonder if they’d ever survive in this era In a time where it’s recreation To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin’ fun at Never the flow though they know I run that Fuck you all I claim that whenever I change rap forever the game back together yup YM I remain that forever In the same place my brother Wayne that forever I’m a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix I haven’t figured it out cause my story is far from finished I’m hearing all of the jokes I know that they tryna push me I know that showin’ emotion don’t ever mean I’m a pussy Know that I don’t make music for niggas who don’t get pussy So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me Lord knows Lord knows I’m heavy I got my weight up Roll this and boost your rate up it’s time that somebody paid up A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up But if all I hear is me then who should I be afraid of? Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin’ spooky Very very scary like shit you see in the movies In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy That’s why all the real soldiers salute me Trill nigga for real [Interlude: Rick Ross] You know I love this YOLO You Only Live Once I’m going so hard my nigga I swear homie Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal [Verse 2: Rick Ross] I fell in love with the pen started fucking in ink The hustle’s an art I paint it what I would think Still allergic to broke prescription straight to the paper Destined for greatness but got a place in Jamaica Villa on the water with the wonderful views Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews Went and got a yacht I’m talkin’ Carnival cruise And these niggas talkin like hoes they mad they not in my shoes It’s the red bottom boss came to buy the bar Every by week shit I’m bound to buy a car Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R Headlights flickin’ lookin’ like a fallin’ star Everyday them hammers bang whippin' yay like Anna Mae I run the game but the ladies think I’m running game Mink coats making women wanna fornicate Rosay and Drake I’m gettin’ cake nothin’ short of great

Don't judge me man They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic They say we lack substance Me 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though [Chorus: Drake] Uh we know what you're thinking love You think we out smoking and drinking love Pushing big whips chains clinking love But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me We know how you speculate Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date Claim we're early and be showing up extra late love But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me [Drake:] Uh El' be saying that I'm humble I'm hella nice For that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice Haters tell you all the rumors they heard And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like I'm Ellen Brice My groove theory is that when you too cheery They try to bring you down to the level they at Well when they are all unhappy then it gets a little sticky That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap But uh they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl Nah they probably think I'll break your heart girl Haha I can't lie you probably right about it And if you give me the ass quick I'll probably write about it But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound I mean I spit that influential shit from my town I don't know why you sitting on the couch When you see I got a bed bring your ass here and lie down You think taking your purse off Will lead to me you taking shirts off and then your skirt off At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee And you probably would've been worse off So I'm a take this hat off and I'm a hit it till I backs off And then I'm back sorrowful Cause you thinking you can predict what happen You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping [Chorus] [Phonte:] You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks Well you can think what you want but I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut You need to get real and check out my real life I ain't a tip-trail don't care what it smell like But if you feel like putting all your notions aside And talking to a real nigga I'd gladly oblige First name Phonte I'd be pleased to date ya College educated got degrees in papers But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping Or rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature Such an anomaly speak so well And talk so collegy such an astonishing Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following On behalf of them I offer my apologies Maybe with me you'll unlearn Putting all niggas in a box of concerns Me cause I ain't dumb shit I'm well reared/red like sunburn And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned uh c'mon [Chorus] [Elzhi:] They say you never judge a book by it's cover Though you appear as materialistic just like the others So I followed your words to take 'em in And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin That's when I felt that I would need to Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you And try to get inside your head only Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me So what I learned on my path to discover? Your story took one ugly turn after another I saw we wasn't on the same page I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way So now I'm closing the case You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face No El' will never judge a book by it's cover Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under [Chorus]

Or is missing what we had outta the question I’m probably just the reason that you learned your lesson I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe’s who’s there before it all I guess thats how it goes they hear about your cons or focus on your pro’s and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul but those same ones from your area will grow into women that are ready to get married at hello because of what they allow where are they all now I know there somewhere watching so I’m trying to make them proud searching for the meaning you’ll find it next to me and tell me I’m the highest guess we finally get to see I’m feeling like Nas who am I to disagree they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key it’s probably why I’m in this bitch shining jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it I’m sorry poolside drinking margharita rounds shout out to my city though I hardly be in town I’m the Black Sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down I’m in the world where things are taken never given how long they choose to love you will never be your decision and I’m aware that this could be the last time you listen so while I’m still here in this position...

This is suppose to be what dreams are made of. But people I don't have the time to hang with always look at me and say the same shit..(they say) You promised me you would never change. You promised me you would never change. [Verse 2] Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on. When 40 got some shit for me to snap on. Now that I'm on I don't really want to worry about getting back on. I'm just trying to stay on get my fucking buffet on. I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home. And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone. But hit redial you see that I just called some chick I met at the mall that I barley know at all and.. Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it. The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it. Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is I'm holding on by a thread it's.. Like I'm high right now the guy right now and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now. That nothing really comes as a surprise right now 'cause we just having the time of our lives right now. [Chorus] What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of. But people I don't have the time to hang with always look at me and say the same shit..(they say) You promised me you would never change. You promised you would never change. [Verse 3] Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices girl Lisa told me. The other day Lisa told that she missed the old me. Which made me question when I went missing. And when I start treating my friends different. Maybe it was the fast paced switch up. Or the two guns in my face during the stick up. Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up. Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up. I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget. I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets. Burn it all burn it all I'm starting it fresh. Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed. Did I just trade free time for camera time? Will I blow all of this money baby Hammer Time? I just need some closure. Aint no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.

,142,drake-azlyrics,drake-azlyrics,142,http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/drake/fear.html,"Fear",[Drake talking:] This is why I do this shit. I think they call this uhm venting. [Verse 1:] Look Uhh. This is me. Still the same. They want the hits. I play the game. No auto tune but you can feel the pain. It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein. What up lil Braw. What up slum Ville. I hope you know that yall the reason I have fun still. The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill. Equal opportunities rapping that shit is unreal. That ain't how it works. That ain't that how it goes. And I be getting high to balance out the lows. And I could use a writer to balance out my flows. But I never share my thoughts This is all a nigga knows. And every time I try it opens up my eyes. These verses are a chance to remembered and reprised. And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive. So every word I utter will be mine. [Chorus:] Don't believe the lies. Look me in my eyes. Please don't be scared of me. Please don't be scared of me. I remember you. This feeling isn't new. So please don't be scared of me. Please don't be scared of me. Oh oh oh oh oh uhh. [Verse 2:] I never cried when Pac died. But I probably will when Hov does. And if my tears hold value then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us. And I'll be standing in a puddle. I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble. And ima keep it honest. I'm so tired of being subtle. Its just me Forty O and Neek standing in a huddle. Staring at the members of my team. Who get questioned about they profit from this 40 million dollar scheme. Just know that I'm in debt for you defending all our dreams. I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems. But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion. You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless. And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions. At least I put it all in the open. [Chorus:] Don't believe the lies. Look me in my eyes. Please don't be scared of me. Please don't be scared of me. I remember you. This feeling isn't new. So please don't be scared of me. Please don't be scared of me. oh oh oh oh oh uhh. [Verse 3:] Look. Fuck all yall. We ignore feelings here. Premature millionaires. Welcome to my realest year. Yeah. I swear we making a killing here. I should be on top of the world here just chilling here. Uh. But its funny having fans. Who find you before anybody ever has the chance and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game. And realize when your there sometimes the shit don't feel the same. Yeah. And plus things are just surreal at home People think I've changed just because my appeal has grown And now security follow me everywhere so I never actually am alone I just always feel alone. I think I'm scared of what the future holds. I was wishing for some things and now am used to those. Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes. The honesty of my music has left me too exposed. All my old friends think I got a new crowd. And people seem to notice every time I do smile. I guess that mean they come few and far between. Even though am living out what you would call the dream. Yeah. And my uncle ain't even messaging me. And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me. I hope this isn't one of those forever things. Its funny how money can change everything. [Chorus:] Don't believe the lies. Look me in my eyes. Please don't be scared of me. Please don't be scared of me. I remember you. This feeling isn't new. So please don't be scared of me. Please don't be scared of me. oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

It's worth it to share it with someone else other than Paris for once I text her from time to time. She a mom now I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down I told her that she could live with me if she needs to. I got a compound but I think she straight 'Cause she supported since hot beats right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room where I was rapping with Jaz over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory He walked right past in the hallway three months later I'm his artist he probably wouldn't remember that story But that shit stick with me always couldn't believe when he called me you never know it could happen to you and I just spent four Ferrari's all on a brand new Bugatti and did that shit 'cause it's something to do Yeah I guess that's just who I became dog nothing was the same dog

Been a minute since we kicked it You've been caught up with them bitches I don't get it you're a star love You shouldn't have to deal with that I'll never make you feel like that [Hook – Jhene Aiko:] Cause I love me I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us So what are you what are you what are you so afraid of? Darling you you give but you cannot take love [Verse 1: Drake] I needed to hear that shit I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I can take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad speaking a lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down girl that nigga's amazing Well fuck it we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups You a flower child beautiful child I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the 70's on your own My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy hah? [Hook] [Verse 2: Drake] Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures Or further back then that before I had the Houston leverage When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit A weak attempt at flexing I'll never forget it Cause that night I played her three songs Then we talked about something we disagreed on Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz Boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me Now she engaged to be married what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit name a couple that isn’t Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl I felt we had it all planned out guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I’m living I just hope I’m forgiven It seems like you don’t want this love anymore I’m acting out in the open it’s hard for you to ignore But girl what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh? [Hook]
