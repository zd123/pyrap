"""
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
360 with the wrist, boy
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself
Whole squad on that real shit
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
Live fast die young, never take it slow
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
And tell me today's weather
And I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
You worked at McDonald's and I eat McDonald's
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
Already had a Rolls Royce
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
knew I was the man by the age of 6
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
Look, just understand that Iâ€™m on a roll like Cottonelle
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show
I'mma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Open cases on me for a half a million each
Hold up, hold my phone
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
Man, I'm doing it better
25, sitting on 25 mill
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
I'll do it for you, that's real
God damn you changed
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
No, don't do it, please don't do it
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
